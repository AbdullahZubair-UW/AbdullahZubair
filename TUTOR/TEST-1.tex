	\section{Preamble}
	This is a test covering what we have learnt so far in lecture, that being Sections 1,2,3. The time expected to complete this test is just under an hour and half granted that the student is adequately prepared. Throughout the test, the student \emph{must show all work} to receive full marks.
	\section{Allowed Aids}
	The following aids are allowed on the Test
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pencil, Pen, Eraser, Ruler, Protractor, Spare sheets of \textbf{blank} paper.
		\item Reference sheet \textbf{(FROM WEBSITE ONLY)}
		\item Basic scientific calculator
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Restrictions:}
	The student is not allowed to communicate with any outside source, nor allowed to access any external aid on the internet,etc. The student may ask the instructor (ME) any questions or confusions but is advised to do so only when all else has failed due to the time constraints.
	\section{Name and Date:}
	Print your name and todays date below;\\

		\item The maximum height I can jump on a trampoline is $d = 5000\m$. I jump $3$ times on the trampoline and the time elapsed was $\Delta t = 20\s$. (\textbf{Assume} that a \emph{single jump} means I reached my maximum height \textbf{and} landed back on the trampoline)
			\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
				\item My average velocity relative to the trampoline was $\vec v_{av} = +1700 \m / \s$. (T / F)
				\item My average speed was $v_{av} = 1.5 \km / \s$. (T / F)
			\end{enumerate}


		\item Suppose that relative to the center of a field, a batsmen stands at $\vec d_i = 50\m$[East]. The batsmen bats a baseball at an average velocity of $\vec v_{av} = 350 \m / \s$[West]. The time elapsed was $\Delta t = 15\s$.
			\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
				\item $\vec d_f = 5200 \m$[East] is the final position vector. (T / F)
				\item The \emph{magnitude} of the average velocity is equal to the average speed. (T / F)
			\end{enumerate}


		\item Consider the Moon orbiting the Earth
			\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
				\item The average velocity of the Moon is \emph{always non-zero} after $t = 0$. (T / F)
				\item The average speed of the Moon is \emph{always non-zero} after $t = 0$. (T / F)
			\end{enumerate}
		
		
		\item Consider the equation of motion of \textcolor{brown}{Car A :} \textcolor{brown}{$x = -\frac{3}{2}t  + 12$} and \textcolor{red}{Car B :} \textcolor{red}{$x = \frac{7}{2}t - 7$}
			\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
				\item Car $A$ has a greater average \emph{speed} than Car $B$. (T / F)
				\item Car $B$ is initially [East] relative to the reference point. (T / F)
				\item Car $A$ is initially [West] relative to the reference point. (T / F) 
				\item Both drivers experienced uniform motion. (T / F)
				\item Car $A$ and Car $B$ will meet at $t = 4\s$. (T / F)

		\item I kick a soccer ball at an average speed $v_{av}$ and it takes $\Delta t$ seconds to reach a distance of $d$ meters.
			\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
				\item Kicking the soccer ball at $2v_{av}$ will allow it to travel $\frac{d}{2}$ meters in $\Delta t$ seconds. (T / F)
				\item Kicking the soccer ball at $\frac{v_{av}}{2}$ implies that it would take $2\Delta t$ seconds to travel $d$ meters. (T / F)

	Two tourists, \textcolor{blue}{Tourist A}, \textcolor{red}{Tourist B}, decide to tour a city, below we depict their Position V. Time plots, \emph{however}, we were only able to record information of \textcolor{blue}{Tourist A} after $t = 1$, and information about \textcolor{red}{Tourist B} after $t = 3$.

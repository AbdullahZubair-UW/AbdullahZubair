\begin{qstn}[12]
Suppose that a train coasting at an average speed of $250 \m / \s$ is headed for a mis-aligned track at a distance $2000\m$ ahead. A man on the train quickly grabs his scooter (which he had hidden away in his luggage) descends the train and attempts to switch the tracks alignment before the train reaches it. The scooter can ride at a maximum average speed of $300 \m / \s$. The train itself needs at least $3$ seconds in order to come to a complete stop. Can the man successfully switch the track in time? Prove that your answer is correct

\begin{qstn}[6]
	Suppose a train took the following route the other day to the following cities; Oshawa, Pickering, Markham, London (Starting at Oshawa). Given below are all of his position vectors along the trip (All relative to \textbf{Toronto}). Compute his average velocity as well as his average speed if the trip took $4 \h$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\vec d_{OSH} = 224\km$[East]
	\item $\vec d_{PKR} = 154\km$[East]
	\item $\vec d_{MRK} = 72\km$[West]
	\item $\vec d_{LND} = 556\km$[East]
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{soln}
		Let us take [East] as the positive direction of motion. We start by computing the average velocity, this strictly relies on the initial and final position vectors relative to Toronto. The initial position vector relative to Toronto is $\vec d_{OSH} = +224\km$. The final position vector is $\vec d_{LND} = +556$, since it is of course our final location and the vector is already given relative to Toronto. Hence,
		$$\vec v_{av} = \frac{\Delta \vec d}{\Delta t} = \frac{+556 \km - (+224\km)}{4\h} = +83 \km / \h = 82 \km / \h \tx{[East]}$$
		To compute the average speed we must compute all displacements. We analyze the number of displacements the train took throughout the journey. We have the following route $(OSH \rightarrow PKR \rightarrow MRK \rightarrow LND)$, hence you have three displacements which we compute separately.
		\begin{align*}
			\Delta \vec d_1 &= \vec d_{PKR} - \vec d_{OSH} = +154\km - (+224\km) = -70\km\\
			\Delta \vec d_2 &= \vec d_{MRK} - \vec d_{PKR} = -72\km - (+154\km) = -226\km\\
			\Delta \vec d_3 &= \vec d_{LND} - \vec d_{MRK} = +556\km - (-72\km) = +628\km\\
			d &= \sum_i |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_i}|\\
			&= |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_1}| + |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_2}| + |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_3}|\\
			&= |-70 \km| + |-226\km| + |+628\km|\\
			&= 924\km
		\end{align*}
		We can now compute the average speed,
		$$v_{av} = \frac{d}{\Delta t} = \frac{924 \km}{4\h} = 231 \km / \h$$

	Two tourists, \textcolor{blue}{Tourist A}, \textcolor{red}{Tourist B}, decide to tour a city, below we depict their Position V. Time plots, \emph{however}, we were only able to record information of \textcolor{blue}{Tourist A} after $t = 1$, and information about \textcolor{red}{Tourist B} after $t = 3$. Your task is to determine the equations of motion for both Tourists using the plots given.

		\begin{soln}
			Let the intersection of the two plots be $A(4,2)$. We need to find the linear equations of motion; $\textcolor{blue}{x_A = m_At + b_A}$, $\textcolor{red}{x_B = m_Bt + b_B}$. We first compute the slope the plot and then afterwards determine the y-intercept of each plot,
			\begin{align*}
				\textcolor{blue}{m_A} &= \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} \tag{I will use points P1 : (6,3), P2 : (4,2)}\\
				&= \frac{2 - 3}{4 - 6}\\
				&= \frac{1}{2}\\
				\textcolor{red}{m_B} &= \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} \tag{I will use points P1 : (6,6), P2 : (4,2)}\\
				&= \frac{2 - 6}{4 - 6}\\
				&= 2
			\end{align*}
			We now have the slope of each plot, we now simply determine the $b$ value for each plot by using a point that exists on their plots. You are free to choose any point, I will choose point $A(4,2)$,
			\begin{align*}
				x_A &= m_At + b_A\\
				x_A &= \frac{1}{2}t + b_A\\
				2 &= \frac{1}{2}\left(4\right) + b_A \tag{Inserting point (4,2)}\\
				b_A &= 0\\
				x_B &= m_Bt + b_B\\
				x_B &= 2t + b_B\\
				2 &= 2(4) + b_B \tag{Inserting point (4,2)}\\
				b_B &= -6
			\end{align*}
			Hence we can construct the equations of motions; 
			$$\textcolor{blue}{x_A = \frac{1}{2}t} \:\:\:\:\: \textcolor{red}{x_B = 2t - 6}$$

\begin{qstn}[9]
A bunny takes a tour around his neighborhood starting at his shelter. He travels $600\m$[East] to House $A$, then from House $A$ he travels $754\m$[West] to House $B$, then from House $B$ he travels $550 \m$[West] to House $C$, and then finally from House $C$ he travels $2\km$[East] to House $D$. Compute his average velocity as well as his average speed if the elapsed time was $\Delta t = 2\Min$. (Assume that the shelter is the reference point)


\begin{soln}
	Let us assign the [East] direction as the positive direction of motion, for the average velocity we must first obtain the initial position vector relative to the shelter, this happens to simply be $\vec d_I = +0\m$. Next we must obtain the final position vector, the final location the bunny ends up is House $D$, hence we need the position vector $\vec d_{DS}$, where the subscript $S$ represents the shelter. For this we use relative vector math operations, observe that we have the following vectors $\vec d_{AS}, \vec d_{BA}, \vec d_{CB}, \vec d_{DC}$, hence we can apply the relative vector proposition over multiple steps to get to desired result. 
	\begin{align*}
		\vec d_{DB} &= \vec d_{DC} + \vec d_{CB}\\
		&= +2000\m + (-550\m) \\
		&= +1450\m\\
		\vec d_{DA} &= \vec d_{DB} + \vec d_{BA}\\
		&= +1450\m + (-754\m)\\
		&= +696\m\\
		\vec d_{DS} &= \vec d_{DA} + \vec d_{AS}\\
		&= +696\m + (+600\m)\\
		&= +1296\m
	\end{align*}
	Hence the final position vector is $\vec d_F = \vec d_{DS} = +1296$, this allows use to compute the average velocity,
$$\vec v_{av} = \frac{\Delta \vec d}{\Delta t} = \frac{+1296\m}{120\s} = +10.8 \m / \s = 10.8 \m / \s \tx{[East]}$$
The average speed is much simpiler, the question gives us the amount he displaces as he traverses his journey $(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D)$. That is, we precisely have all displacement vectors $\Delta \vec d_1 = \vec d_{AS}, \Delta \vec d_2 = \vec d_{BA}, \Delta \vec d_3 = \vec d_{CB}, \Delta \vec d_4 = \vec d_{DC}$. Therefore we compute the distance traveled using the Corollary, afterwards we compute the average speed,
\begin{align*}
	d &= \sum_i |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_i}|\\
	&= |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_1}| + |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_2}| +|\overrightarrow{\Delta d_3}| + |\overrightarrow{\Delta d_4}|\\
	&= |+600\m| + |-754\m| + |-550| + |+2000\m|\\
	&= 600\m  + 754\m + 550\m + 2000\m\\
	&= 3904\m \\
	v_{av} &= \frac{d}{\Delta t} = \frac{3904\m}{120s} = 32.533 \m / \s
\end{align*}

\begin{qstn}[10]
Suppose that I fire an arrow straight up into the air from a cliff at a position $\vec d_{CG} = 56\m$[North] relative to the ground. Suppose that a wooden box $14\m$ high is lying on the ground, and that the arrow lands directly on top of it. Compute the average velocity as well as the average speed of the arrow if the duration of the flight was $\Delta t = 45\s$. (Hint : The reference point is your choice)


\begin{soln}
	Let $A$ denote the subscript of the arrow. Let us choose [North] as the positive direction of motion, let us assign the reference point as the cliff (C). The initial position vector of the arrow (A) relative to the cliff is $d_I = +0\m$. The final position vector $\vec d_{AC}$ of the arrow relative to the cliff may be computed by implementing the relative vector proposition as well as the proposition which states that $-\vec d_{AB} = \vec d_{BA}$. Note that because the arrow lands on a box that is $14\m$ from the ground, the position vector of the arrow relative to the ground is $\vec d_{AG} = +14\m$,
	$$\vec d_{AC} = \vec d_{AG} + \vec d_{GC} =  \vec d_{AG} + (-\vec d_{CG}) = +14\m + (-56\m) = -42\m$$ 
	Hence we have the final position vector $\vec d_f = \vec d_{AC} = -42\m$. We can now compute the average velocity,
	$$\vec v_{av} = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec d_F - \vec d_I}{45} = \frac{-42\m - (+0\m)}{45\s} = -0.933 \m / \s$$

	\textcolor{blue}{Runner $A$} and \textcolor{orange}{Runner $B$} run back and forth across a $50\m$ track initially starting at position $(0,0)$ and facing [East] (Assume that [East] is the positive direction of motion). \textcolor{blue}{Runner $A$} has an average speed \textcolor{blue}{$v_{av} = 15 \m / \s$} and \textcolor{orange}{Runner $B$} has an average speed of \textcolor{orange}{$v_{av} = 20 \m / \s$}. After an elapsed time of $\Delta t = 1\Min$, what was the position vector of \textcolor{blue}{Runner $A$} relative to \textcolor{orange}{Runner $B$} (i.e $\vec d_{\textcolor{blue}{A}\textcolor{orange}{B}}$) 


	\begin{soln}
		Let us first determine the amount of time it will take each runner to reach the end of the track, let this time for Runner $A$ be $\textcolor{blue}{\Delta t_A}$ and the time for Runner $B$ to be $\textcolor{orange}{\Delta t_B}$.
		\begin{align*}
			\textcolor{blue}{\Delta t_A }&= \frac{d}{\textcolor{blue}{v_{av}}} = \frac{10}{3}\s \\
			\textcolor{orange}{\Delta t_B} &= \frac{d}{\textcolor{orange}{v_{av}}}= \frac{5}{2} \s
		\end{align*}
	\textbf{\underline{\large{Key Observations:}}}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If it takes $\Delta t$ seconds to reach the end of the track, then any integer multiple of $\Delta t \cdot k$ would mean that you have covered the track $k$ times. This means that after $\Delta t \cdot k$ seconds, the runner is either at the start or end of the track.
		\item Let $\Delta t$ be the time it takes for a runner to reach the end of the track. Then by the end of even multiples times of $\Delta t$ ($2\Delta$, $4\Delta t$, etc) correspond to a Runner facing in the [East] direction and by the end of odd multiple times of $\Delta t$ correspond to a Runner facing in the [West] direction. This is because both runners start facing [East], by the end of $\Delta t$, they will begin facing [West], then after $2\Delta$ they will face east again and so on.
	\end{enumerate}
	Observation 1 tells us that if $\Delta t \cdot k = 60$ has an integer solution for $k$, then that Runner is either at the front of the room or at the back of the room. Observation 2 tells us that if $k$ is even then that Runner is facing [East], else he is facing [West]. Lets compute these results,
	\begin{align*}
		\textcolor{blue}{\Delta t_A}\cdot k &= 60\\
		\frac{10}{3}\cdot k &= 60\\
		k &= 18\\
		\textcolor{orange}{\Delta t_B} \cdot k &= 60\\
		\frac{5}{2}\cdot k &= 60\\
		k &= 24
	\end{align*}
	Hence we have found solutions for $k$ for both Runner $A$ and Runner $B$, also both $k$ values are even implying by the end of $60$ seconds, both runners have returned to the start of the track and are at the same location. Hence $\vec d_{\textcolor{blue}{A}\textcolor{orange}{B}} = +0\m$.

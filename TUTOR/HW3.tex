    % The command \circled[]{} accepts one optional and one mandatory argument.
    % Optional argument is for the size of the circle and mandatory argument is for its contents.
    % \circled{A} produces circled A, with size drawn for letter A. \circled[TT]{A} produces circled A with size drawn for TT.

\begin{qstn}[1] % qnumber, qname, qpoints
    Answer the following True/False questions (\textbf{Assume [East] is positive})
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A runner completes a $100\m$ sprint at an average speed of $50 \m / \s$.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item The time it took to complete the race was $10$\s. (T / F)
            \item If the runner wishes to complete a $1\km$ race in the same amount of time as he completed the $100\m$ race, his average speed must be $500 \m / \s$. (T / F)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The position v. time plot of a vehicle over the highway was similar to the plot $y = x$.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item The vehicle experienced uniform motion (T / F)
            \item The average velocity was positive (T / F)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The position v. time plot of a vehicle over the highway was similar to the plot $y = -4$
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item The vehicle experienced uniform motion (T / F)
            \item The vehicle is [East] of the reference point (T / F)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Two runners compete in a race starting from $(0,0)$, runner $X$ and runner $Y$. Runner $X$ has a Pos v. Time plot similar to $y = 4x$ and Runner $Y$ has a Pos v. Time plot similar to $y = x$.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item Runner $Y$ won the race (T / F)
            \item If the race lasted $4$ seconds, then final position vector of Runner $X$ was $\vec d_X = 12\m$[East] (T / F)
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}

 \end{qstn}



 \begin{qstn}[2]
    Using the $x-$dimensional coordinate system, and choosing $(x \rightarrow )$ as the positive direction, I decided to track my tour around the area the other day. All position vectors are recorded relative to $(0,0)$. I \emph{began} my journey at $d_1 = + 5\m$, then,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\vec d_2 = + 7\m$
        \item $\vec d_3 = -18\m$
        \item $\vec d_4 = +11\m$
    \end{itemize}
    If the tour lasted for $10\Min$, determine my average velocity as well as my average speed over the tour.
 \end{qstn}



\begin{qstn}[3]
    A tourist traverses $412\km[\tx{W}]$ to the Canada starting from UK. From Canada, he traverses $805\km[\tx{E}]$ to Egypt. Finally, from Egypt he traverses $98\km$[\tx{E}] to Saudi Arabia. If the journey took $2 \h$, determine his average velocity as well as his average speed. 
\end{qstn}


\begin{qstn}[4]
    Racer $X$, Racer $Y$ and Racer $Z$ compete in the Grand Motor Sport. Below is position v. time plot for each of the racers, \textcolor{purple}{Racer $X$},\textcolor{red}{Racer $Y$},\textcolor{blue}{Racer $Z$}. Prove that \textcolor{blue}{Racer $Z$} won the race.(Assume that the race lasted for $5$ seconds)

\begin{qstn}[5]
A ball is dropped from a cliff $20\m$[North] relative to the ground. The ball bounces off the ground and reaches a final position $15\m$[South] relative to the cliff. The entire trip took $12$ seconds. Determine,
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item The average velocity of the ball
    \item The average speed of the ball
    \item The Pos v. Time plot of the ball
\end{enumerate}

\begin{qstn}[6]
    A sprinter completes a sprint (returning back to his starting position) in $30$ seconds around a circular track with radius $15\m$. Compute the sprinters,
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item Average speed
        \item Average velocity
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{qstn}[7]
    Car $A$ and Car $B$ are about to race each other, however Car $B$ wants to challenge himself by letting car $A$ have a $3$ second head start. If car $A$ has an average speed of $120 \m / \s$, at what average speed must Car $B$ race at in order to tie the race? The length of the race track is $4.2 \km$.
\end{qstn}


\begin{qstn}[8]
    The Robetson's Family are interested in doing business with a particular salesmen. They decide to drive over to Toronto to catch him at his bus stop before he departs. Let us suppose that this bus stop is located at $(0,0)$. The Roberston's mistakenly passed this bus stop, not knowing that the salesmen was at this particular one, and only realized they missed him after having traveled to a position $\vec d = +100\m$ relative to the bus stop, at an average speed of $60 \m / \s$. The \emph{exact} moment they passed him was the moment that his bus started to travel in a direction [West] relative to the bust stop at an average velocity of $50 \m / \s $[\tx{West}]. If at the exact moment the Robertson's had reached the position $\vec d = +100\m$, the salesmen got off at his next stop, at what speed must the Roberston's travel at in order to catch up to him within $30$ seconds?
